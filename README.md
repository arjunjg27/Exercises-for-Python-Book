Hello to whoever reads this. I am a somewhat new coder as I have experience in Python, 
but I wanted to learn more about programming so I bought a book to help me. 
Now in this bok there are 4 languages it goes over, Python, Java, SQL, and JavaScript.
Once I am done reading and doing all the exercises of Python and uploading them here.
I will move onto Java and so on and so forth.
Have fun reading my code that has no comments and is horendous.
